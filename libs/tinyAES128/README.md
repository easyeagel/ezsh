### Tiny AES128 in C

This is a small and portable implementation of the AES128 ECB encryption algorithm written in C.

The API is very simple and looks like this (I am using C99 `<stdint.h>`-style annotated types):

```C
void AES128_ECB_encrypt(uint8_t* input, uint8_t* key, uint8_t* output);
void AES128_ECB_decrypt(uint8_t* input, uint8_t* key, uint8_t* output);
```

The module uses just a bit more than 200 bytes of RAM and 2.5K ROM when compiled for ARM (~2K for Thumb but YMMV).

It is the smallest implementation in C I've seen yet, but do contact me if you know of something smaller (or have improvements to the code here).


I've successfully used the code on 64bit x86, 32bit ARM and 8 bit AVR platforms.


GCC size output when compiled for ARM:



    $ arm-none-eabi-gcc -Os -c aes.c
    $ size aes.o
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
       2515       0     204    2719     a9f aes.o


.. and when compiling for the THUMB instruction set, we end up around 2K in code size.

    $ arm-none-eabi-gcc -mthumb -Os -c aes.c
    $ size aes.o
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
       1883       0     204    2087     827 aes.o


I am using Mentor Graphics free ARM toolchain:
